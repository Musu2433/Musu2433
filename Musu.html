<h1>Travelling in Depression</h1>
<p>
  When i was very little,i caught the travel buy.it started after my grandparents first brought me to their home in<br>
  France and i have now been twent-nine different countries.Each has given me a unique learning experience.
      <br><br>
      
      At five,i marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the city of lights.When i was eight,i stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco<br>
      feeding hordes of pigeons,then glided down venetian waterways on sleek gondolas.At thirteen,i saw the ancient,<br>
      megalithic structure of Stonehenge and walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the thousand-year-old <br>
      stones were still in place.</p>
      
      <p> It was through exploring cultures around the world that i first became interested in language.</p>

   <p>It began with French,which taught me the importance of pronunciation. <br>
   I remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des pyramides was.<br>But when I pronounced it PYR-a-mides instead of pyr-A-mides, with more accent <br>
   on the A, she looked at me bewildered.
   <br><br>
   
   In the eighth grade,I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of its <br>
   similarities with English through cognates. Baseball in Spanish, for example, is<br>
   béisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same, This was incredible<br>
   to me as it made speech and compression more fluid, and even today I <br>
   find that cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in <br> Spanish.<br><br>
   
  Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied <br>
  Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a <br>
  character, the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were formed by <br>
  combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) meaning<br>
  mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano. I love <br>
  spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.
